# Universal Composability in Lean

A formalization of the [UC Cryptographic framework](https://eprint.iacr.org/2000/067.pdf) in Lean 3.

I started this repo as a class project. I have been thinking it might be nice at some point to port it to Lean 4 and develop it more, maybe integrating some of my other work.

Some potentially relevant papers:

* ["A Simpler Variant of Universally Composable Security for Standard Multiparty Computation"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/553.pdf)
* ["Algebraic Adversaries in the Universal Composability Framework"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1218)
* ["Categorical composable cryptography"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13232.pdf) (Note Lean defines Symmetric Monoidal Categories)
